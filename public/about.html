<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is my Journey to become a Web Developer</p>
<p>I have originaly worked in a catering buisess for almsot 8 years. 
  After all those years i have grown and learned alot of things. 
  Working with customers planning their Party or Weddings, 
  gaining higher stress tolerance and i also have learned 
  that this job did not align with intrests. My Work life Balance was non existent and 
  because it mentally and physically affected me and 
  alongside i had no Quality time with my Family, i have made a cut and decided to change my Life</p>

  <p>I wanted to learn something new, after months of research i have found a course on Udemy that 
    teaches me to code and later it will show me how to program. i'm very excited and enjoy these challenges!
    I will stay determnined on my path to become a Web Devoloper!
